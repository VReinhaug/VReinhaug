# Hello! 👋

## Veronika here 🙋🏻‍♀️

I am a part time front end development student at Noroff, and if everything goes as planned (🤞) I will graduate in 2026! 

When I am not studying I work as a web manager in Oslo. Apart from these two time consuming things I:
- 🌍 love traveling
- ☕️ drink way too much coffee
- 🪴 try to get some green fingers
- 🤸‍♀️ judge gymnastics

## So far I have learned about:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- WordPress
- GitHub
